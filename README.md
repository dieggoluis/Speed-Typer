# Speed Typer

<p align="justify">
Typing races have become pretty common among multiple computer users, specially program- mers. While the most common version are those where the user has to type a given phrase (in a sort of a guided version), this project tries to implement a simpler version: the user must type the maximum quantity of words in English during a given time.
